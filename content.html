<h2>Topography as a driving force</h2>
Topography controls water flow, sediment transport, inundation,
landslides, and determines solar irradiation
<img src="img/processes.png">
<aside class="notes">
As Doreen last time was talking about using computational models for simulating larval dispersal,
in our group  we work a lot with models simulating hydrological models, soil erosion, but also solar radiation.
What these models have in common is that topography is the driving input to all these processes.

To explore different scenarios with these models, it is quite difficult to modify
topography in the form of digital elevation models on the computer, even using specialized
software with nice graphical user interface. It is unintuitive and requires certain level of expertise.

On the other hand, shaping things by hand is very natural and since it is effortless, it allows people to be 
more creative. We took advantage of this and developed a tangible user interface for
the computational models, we call Tangible Landscape.

I will first explain the setup of the system.
 On the table we have a physical terrain model which is scanned by the 
scanner, in this case we use Microst Kinect for Windows, the gaming device.
Above, there is projector, and then we computer where we run the geospatial analyses.
We use GRASS GIS, an open source Geographic information system,
where a wide range of analyses are implemented,
from basic terrain analyses tools to more complicated hydrological models,
erosion/deposition models. 

So how does this work?

<aside class="notes">
We can change the surface of the physical model and our changes
are then scanned and processed in the GIS and the results are
projected back on the physical model so you can quickly see what are the impacts 
of your changes. The scan of the physical model is
georeferenced and scaled to the real-world dimensions which ensures the
results from the simulations are realistic.

In this case, we are running overland water flow model durign a storm event on a physical model
of a real place in Raleigh, you can see the ortho photo projected. You can see the road
which is being flooded.

Since the road is relatively new, built in 2003, we might ask, how is the waterflow
affected by this road, what happens if it isn't there?
So I just removed the road from the model.

In the last scenario, I made the culvert very narrow to explore
what happens if the culvert gets clogged.
Since the water can't flow out, we get a large pool, eventually 
overflowing the road.

In the second case study, we will explote subsurface, specifically
soil moisture data in the form of 3D raster or voxel model if you like.

We can look under the ground and explore the place 
as if we were at an excavation site by digging into the sand
with our hands.
